Your Enhanced To-Do List Page

I see you've taken the basic To-Do List page and enhanced it with a more modern design and additional features. Your code is well-structured, and I'll provide some feedback and suggestions to further improve it.

Design and Layout

Your design is clean and minimalistic, with a focus on usability. The use of flexbox and CSS grid makes the layout responsive and easy to manage. The color scheme is pleasant, and the typography is clear and readable.

JavaScript Code

Your JavaScript code is well-organized, and the functions are easy to understand. You've implemented the following features:

Add Task: The addTodo function creates a new list item with the task text, edit, complete, and delete buttons.
Remove Task: The removeTodo function removes the list item when the delete button is clicked.
Toggle Complete: The toggleComplete function toggles the completed class on the list item when the complete button is clicked.
Edit Task: The editTodo function prompts the user to edit the task text and updates the list item accordingly.
Suggestions and Improvements

Consider using a more robust editing mechanism: Instead of using the prompt function, you could create a more user-friendly editing experience by using a text input field or a modal window.
Add keyboard navigation: Implement keyboard navigation to allow users to navigate the list using arrow keys and press Enter to add or edit tasks.
Improve accessibility: Add ARIA attributes and roles to make the To-Do List page more accessible to users with disabilities.
Consider using a JavaScript framework or library: If you plan to add more features or complexity to your To-Do List page, consider using a JavaScript framework or library like React, Angular, or Vue.js to make development and maintenance easier.
Overall, your enhanced To-Do List page is a great starting point, and with some additional refinements, it can become an even more useful and user-friendly tool.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or provide further guidance on implementing them?
